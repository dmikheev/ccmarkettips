# Cookie Clicker Market Tips
Simple Stock Market Tips addon for Cookie Clicker

Calculates "Resting Value" for each stock and displays below the stock value along with a recommendation for whether you should buy or sell.
It's not get very smart and can't tell if a stock is going up and down so use your own judgement. The mod bases its decision purely on current price and not trajectory.

Right now this addon is very very light and that is all it does.
